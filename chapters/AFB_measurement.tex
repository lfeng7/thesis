\chapter{Measurement of $\ttbar$ Forawd-backward Asymmetry}
\label{sec:afb measurement}

In this chapter, we first introduce the empirical motivation and theoretical formulation of the template based $\AFB$ measurement. Next, the method and result of kinematic reconstruction of $\ttbar$ pairs from the momentum of observed final states is provided. Then, we describe the details of the actual implementation of the template fit based on the maximal likelihood method. Afterwards, the systematic uncertainties in this measurement as well as the study of the sensitivity is described. Finally, the measurement result and discussion is provided.
