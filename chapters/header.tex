\begin{abstract}

This thesis presents a measurement of Forward-Backward Asymmetry($\displaystyle{A_{FB}}$) in $t\bar{t}$ production. The data sample corresponds to $19.7\,\textrm{fb}^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 8\,\textrm{TeV}$ collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. Events selected contain a single isolated muon or electron, with four or five jets of which two are b-tagged. A template technique is used to extract the asymmetry from the top quark kinematic distributions. This technique is based upon an extension of the tree-level cross section for $q\bar{q}$ initial states that sensitively isolates $q\bar{q}$ from $gg/qg$ initial states. The measured $A_{FB}$ and relative aboundance of $q\bar{q}$ initiated $t\bar{t}$ are measured and compared to both theoretical calculation and results from D0 and CDF experiments of Tevatron.
